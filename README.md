## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

‚Ä¢ A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
‚Ä¢ Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
‚Ä¢ Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
‚Ä¢ Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
‚Ä¢ Market price tracking.
‚Ä¢ Voice support for low-literate users.
‚Ä¢ Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

‚Ä¢ Small and marginal farmers
‚Ä¢ Agricultural extension officers
‚Ä¢ Government agriculture departments
‚Ä¢ NGOs and cooperatives
‚Ä¢ Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

‚Ä¢ 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
‚Ä¢ Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20‚Äì30%.

## Proposed Solution
Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution:
UzhavarKootam is a digital platform for farmers that combines three main features:
AI Advisory Bot ‚Äî Gives instant, easy-to-understand farming advice in Tamil and Tanglish on topics like crop care, pest control, irrigation, and weather.
Farmer Community Forum ‚Äî A social space where farmers can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from each other.
Live Market Price Tracker ‚Äî Shows real-time crop prices from local markets so farmers can sell at the best rate.
It also includes a knowledge library with seasonal guides and videos, plus offline and voice-based access for farmers with low internet access or literacy.

How It Addresses the Problem:
Instant Advice: Farmers get quick, local guidance without waiting for expert visits.
Price Awareness: Real-time price updates help farmers avoid middlemen and sell at better rates.
Community Support: Farmers connect and share knowledge in one trusted space.
Easy Access: Voice and offline features ensure usability for all farmers.
One Platform: Combines advice, community, and market tools, replacing scattered services.

Innovation and Uniqueness
Culturally Rooted: Inspired by Tamil traditions (Kalappai and Kootam) for community and sharing.
Localized AI: Supports Tamil language and regional farming needs.
Digital Village: A community that replicates traditional gatherings online.
Market Intelligence: Real-time price tracking in one platform.
Inclusive Access: Works with voice and offline mode for farmers with low digital skills.
Integrated Solution: Combines advisory, community, and market features in one app, unlike existing fragmented tools.
