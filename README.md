## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
1. Precision Agriculture

Implement soil testing and mapping to optimize nutrient management.

Use variable rate technology (VRT) for fertilizers and irrigation to reduce input costs and environmental impact.

Employ drones and IoT sensors to monitor crop health, soil moisture, and pest/disease outbreaks in real-time.

2. Data-Driven Decision Making

Leverage AI-based crop advisory tools for predictive analytics on yield, pest risk, and climate impact.

Maintain a digital record of crop history and input usage to identify patterns and optimize future cycles.

Integrate weather forecasts into planning for irrigation, sowing, and harvesting schedules.

3. Sustainable Practices

Adopt integrated pest management (IPM) to minimize chemical use and encourage natural pest control.

Implement crop rotation and cover cropping to improve soil health and biodiversity.

Explore organic or bio-fertilizers where possible to enhance sustainability.

4. Market Intelligence

Track real-time commodity prices and demand trends to decide on cropping and sale timing.

Consider direct-to-market channels or cooperatives to reduce middlemen and increase profit margins.

5. Technology & Training

Stay updated with agri-tech innovations like smart irrigation, remote sensing, and crop simulation models.

Train farm staff on digital tools, machinery, and monitoring systems to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

Utilize AI/ML models for disease prediction and yield optimization.

6. Knowledge Sharing

Participate in agri-science forums, webinars, and farmer networks to exchange insights.

Share best practices with smallholder farmers to improve community outcomes and build goodwill.

## Technical Approach
1.Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multiple languages.

Geolocation APIs for field-specific recommendations.

2.Mobile-based soil test reporting.

Machine learning models for nutrient optimization.

3.Integration with meteorological APIs.

AI models predicting crop stress from weather data.

4.Computer vision with deep learning for disease detection.

Offline mode for low-connectivity areas.

5.Market scraping APIs or government database integration.

6.Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) engines.

7.Analytics dashboards and machine learning for continuous improvement.
