## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
We propose a Smart Crop Companion—a mobile-first, AI-driven advisory platform that speaks the farmer’s language, understands their soil, and predicts their challenges. It will combine satellite data, weather APIs, and farmer inputs to deliver hyper-local recommendations. The app will be designed for simplicity, with voice support and offline capabilities to ensure accessibility in remote areas.


## Technical Approach
- Languages & Tools: Python (AI), React Native (App), Firebase (Backend), OpenCV (Image Analysis)
- Modules:
- Crop Recommendation Engine
- Pest Detection via Image Upload
- Weather Alert System
- Market Price Tracker
- Voice Assistant (Regional Language Support)
- Process Flow:
- Farmer inputs basic data (location, crop history)
- App fetches weather and soil data
- AI engine generates advisory
- Farmer receives voices/text guidance
- Feedback loop refines future suggestions


## Feasibility and Viability
 - Feasibility: High, due to mobile penetration and existing tech stack
- Challenges: Language diversity, data accuracy, digital literacy
- Mitigation:
- Regional language support
- Community onboarding via NGOs
- Offline mode for low-connectivity zones

Impact & Benefits
- Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge and confidence
- Economic: Boosts productivity, reduces input costs
- Environmental: Promotes sustainable practices and reduces chemical overuse
