## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The solution is an **AI-based multilingual mobile app** that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory for small and marginal farmers. The app will use **machine learning models** to recommend suitable crops based on soil conditions, weather data, and crop history. It will also provide recommendations on pest control, fertilizer usage, and other critical aspects of farming. The app will offer:

- **Soil health recommendations** and **fertilizer guidance** based on soil type.
- **Weather-based alerts** and **predictive insights** to help farmers plan better.
- **Pest/disease detection** via **image uploads** from the app.
- **Voice support** for farmers with low literacy, enabling easy interaction with the app.
- **Multilingual support**, ensuring it is accessible to farmers in their native language.

This solution will empower farmers with scientifically-backed, localized advisory and support sustainable farming practices.

## Technical Approach
**Technologies to be used:**

- **Frontend**: React Native (for mobile app development on both iOS and Android).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API handling.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, crop information, weather data, etc.
- **Machine Learning Models**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for crop recommendation and pest detection.
- **Image Recognition**: OpenCV and TensorFlow for image-based pest or disease detection.
- **Voice Support**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice interaction.
- **Weather Data**: OpenWeather API for fetching real-time weather data.
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS or Google Cloud for hosting the backend and ML models.

**Methodology and Process for Implementation:**

1. **User Profile**: The farmer creates a profile with location, soil type, and crop history.
2. **Data Collection**: Real-time weather data and soil health information is fetched via APIs.
3. **AI-based Crop Recommendation**: Based on user data, the app recommends the best crops for the current season.
4. **Pest/Disease Detection**: The app uses image recognition to detect pests and suggest remedies.
5. **Notifications and Alerts**: Farmers receive notifications based on weather changes, pest outbreaks, or market prices.

## Feasibility and Viability

- **Feasibility**: This project is feasible given the current availability of mobile app development frameworks, AI/ML models, and agricultural APIs. The technology stack is widely adopted and suitable for building scalable solutions.
  
- **Challenges and Risks**:
  1. **Low Digital Literacy**: Some farmers may find it difficult to use the app due to low literacy or unfamiliarity with smartphones.
     - **Solution**: Include voice-based interactions and offer training sessions through local NGOs.
  
  2. **Limited Internet Connectivity**: In rural areas, internet access might be limited.
     - **Solution**: Develop an offline mode where data is stored locally and synced when the internet is available.

- **Strategies to Overcome Challenges**:
  1. Collaborate with local government agencies and NGOs to ensure wider adoption and provide training.
  2. Implement offline features for farmers with limited connectivity.
  3. Integrate low-bandwidth options for faster data transfer.


## Impact and Benefits

- **Impact on Target Audience**:
  - **Small Farmers**: Directly improves decision-making, leading to better crop yields and lower input costs.
  - **Agricultural Extension Officers**: Facilitates better communication and real-time advisory, reducing reliance on third-party advice.

- **Benefits**:
  1. **Social**: Empower farmers with scientific knowledge in their native language and help bridge the digital divide.
  2. **Economic**: Increase productivity, reduce input costs, and improve the financial stability of farmers.
  3. **Environmental**: Encourage sustainable farming practices by optimizing fertilizer and pesticide use.
