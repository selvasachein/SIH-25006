## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-driven, multilingual crop advisory mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized, location-based recommendations to small and marginal farmers. By integrating soil health data, weather information, crop history, and pest detection models, the system delivers scientific guidance in real time. Farmers will be able to upload images for pest or disease identification, receive fertilizer usage suggestions tailored to their soil type, and access real-time market prices. Voice-enabled interaction in local languages ensures inclusivity for farmers with low literacy levels.

The innovation lies in combining image recognition, AI-powered recommendation systems, and multilingual voice technology into a single, farmer-friendly platform. Unlike existing generic advisories, this system prioritizes personalization, simplicity, and accessibility, making it unique and impactful.

## Technical Approach
Technologies Used:

AI/ML for pest/disease detection and crop recommendations

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual support and chatbot integration

Cloud-based services for data storage, weather API integration, and real-time updates

Mobile application framework (e.g., Flutter/React Native) for cross-platform accessibility

IoT sensors (optional integration) for soil and climate data capture

Implementation Methodology:

Farmer registers with basic details (land size, soil type, preferred language, crops).

App collects real-time weather and soil data via APIs or IoT (optional).

AI processes input to suggest crops, fertilizers, and practices.

Farmer can upload pest/disease images for instant diagnosis.

Voice-based chatbot provides advice in the farmer’s native language.

Market integration provides nearest mandi prices and demand trends.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is feasible as it leverages existing technologies (AI/ML, cloud data, mobile apps) while addressing digital literacy challenges through language support and voice interaction. Initial deployment can be in regional pilot districts with high smartphone penetration, gradually scaling up.

Challenges:

Limited internet access in rural areas

Training farmers to use the system

Accuracy of AI models in diverse farming conditions

Mitigation Strategies:

Offline-first design for mobile app

Training sessions in collaboration with agricultural departments/NGOs

Continuous AI model improvement using farmer-uploaded images and feedback

## Impact and Benefits
Social: Empowers farmers with scientific knowledge and reduces dependency on intermediaries.

Economic: Increases yield, reduces input costs, improves farmer profitability.

Environmental: Promotes optimized fertilizer/pesticide usage, reducing soil and water pollution.

Sustainability: Strengthens food security and rural development.
